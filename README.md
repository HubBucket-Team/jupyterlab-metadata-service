# JupyterLab Metadata Service

[![Stability Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/stability-experimental-red.svg)](https://img.shields.io/badge/stability-experimental-red.svg)

A metadata service, client and UI for the metadata schema of [schema.org](https://schema.org/). Our plan is to build an architecture that enables everything in JupyterLab (notebooks, text files, datasets, etc.) to have metadata attached to it.
